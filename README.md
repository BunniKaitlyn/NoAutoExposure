# Deprecated
This plugin is no longer needed, as modern Beat Saber's Auto-Exposure implementation is better now. You should remove this plugin as it tends to screw up lightshows made after 1.24.0 was released.

## NoAutoExposure
Turns off the auto-exposure added in 1.24.0, no configuration. Just install this plugin, and enjoy!
